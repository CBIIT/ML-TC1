## *Cancer Site/Type classification using Convolutional Neural Network*
*Presented by S. Ravichandran, Ph.D., BIDS, Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research (FNLCR)*

This document will explain how to use genomic expression data for classifying different cancer/tumor sites/types. This workshop is a follow-up to the NCI-DOE Pilot1 benchmark also called TC1. You can read about the project here, https://github.com/ECP-CANDLE/Benchmarks/tree/master/Pilot1/TC1

To begin: 

* Click the launch Binder button below to begin tutorial using the dynamic versions of **TC1-dataprep.ipynb** and **TC1-ConvNN.ipynb**

  [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/ravichas/ML-TC1/master)

 * ***Please note that Binder server setup on the cloud will take < 3 minutes at most. You will first see a Binder page with some log messages. After the setup, you will see an instance of Jupyer notebook in your browser. Click the Jupyter notebook, predict-drugclass.ipynb, to begin the tutorial***.
  
  * *Binder does not work with Safari on Mac OS, instead use the Chrome browser. If you are on Windows, please use Chrome.*


* If you have trouble with Binder, click either **TC1-dataprep.ipynb** or **TC1-ConvNN.ipynb** above to view a static Python JupyterNotebook.
